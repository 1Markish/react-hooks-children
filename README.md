# BONUS: React Children

## Learning Goals

- Use React Children to compose multiple components together
- Access the `children` prop to return a child component

## Why do we need children?

In HTML, encapsulating several bits of UI can be as easy as wrapping them in a
single element. For example:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h1>Hello, I'm in a container!</h1>
  <p>I'm a description!</p>
</div>
```

In the above code, the `h1` and `p` tags are direct children of the `div`,
meaning that they are rendered within `div`. In other words, they are **part**
of the `div`.

In React, you might create a reusable version of this HTML by doing the following:

```jsx
function Header(props) {
  return (
    <div class="container">
      <h1>{props.header}</h1>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `header` and `description` props help us make the Header component reusable,
as seen here:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <Header header="Hello, I'm in a container!", description="I'm a description!" />
    <Header header="I'm another container", description="Whoa that's weird!" />
    <Header header="A third container!", description="Cray cray" />
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

This is great when we want UI that has the same structure with different
text/attributes. We can even use conditional rendering to help us choose when to
render parts of the UI. Not bad! But consider the following HTML:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h1>Hello, I'm in a container!</h1>
  <p>I'm a description!</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <strong>Image description</strong>
  <div class="image-wrapper"/>
    <img src="img/src" alt="text"/>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h4>People</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Evans "Wangtron" Wang</li>
    <li>Andrew "Chrome Boi" Cohn </li>
    <li>Tashawn "Thursdays" Williams</li>
    <li>Alex "Friggin'" Griffith</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

In this example, we have 3 `div`s each with the same class name, but entirely
different children and internal structure. `props` won't help us here: each
`div` has such radically different content. From what we know of React, we would
be forced to write 3 different components, each with the same wrapping `div` but
entirely different contents. Wouldn't it be nice if you could write one
component that can keep much of the same _external_ structure but render
different components _internally_? Enter the `children` prop.

## How do we make children?

So far you've seen components rendered like this using the **self-closing tag**
syntax:

```jsx
function Example(props) {
  return <div>{props.exampleProp}</div>;
}

<Example exampleProp="example value" />;
```

However, React also allows you to use your components with an **opening and
closing tag**, like most HTML elements:

```jsx
<Example exampleProp="example value">
  <h1>Example header!</h1>
  <p>Some example text</p>
</Example>
```

If you were to use the above definition of the `Example` component, you would
observe no difference at all: the `h1` and `p` would not be rendered. However,
if you inspect the props in `Example`, you'll notice a new prop has been added:
`children`.

A closer look at this prop reveals that this props contains an array, and at
each element of the array is a component! In this case, you'll see an `h1` and a
`p` tag, in that order. Rendering these children is the same as rendering any
array of components:

```jsx
function Example(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.exampleProp}
      {/* using the children prop to render any elements inside the opening and closing tag of Example */}
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

And voila! You have a component that is able to render its children! Any valid
JSX elements, including your own components and nested JSX elements, can be used
as children.

## An example of working children

To run our example, run `npm install && npm start`.

You'll notice that our `App` component renders two `Container` components, each
with distinct children. Take a look at the code for `Container`: spend some time
figuring out what each prop does. (Note: we're using default values for our
destructured props to provide a value for a prop in case no values are provided
by the parent component). You'll notice there are 5 props: `direction`,
`header`, `textPosition`, `contentPosition`, and `children`. We've already
discussed `children`, but try to figure out what the others do!

## Conclusion

Using React Children greatly expands your ability to make reusable components.
While you won't see as many examples of this style of writing components when
you're first getting started with React, this pattern is an incredibly useful
one to master. In addition to helping with component reusability, it can also
help with needing to pass props down multiple levels of the component hierarchy.
